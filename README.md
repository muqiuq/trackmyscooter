# Track my Scooter

Small fun project to "protect" my scooter against theft or misplacement during the 36C3 in Leipzig. 

A lack of hardware and time forced me to use a primitive approach using:
 - A Wemos D1 mini (ESP8266)
 - a tilt sensor 
 - a piezzo
 - two LEDs (for effects)
 - three push buttons (for code entry)

Still no finished. Code is a mess.
